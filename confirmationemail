### **2. Quick Start Protocol**

To properly secure your legacy, please follow the **Legacy Grove** setup guide:

1. 
**Fill Out at Your Own Pace:** Complete each section honestly, from your master identity sheet to your online business assets.


2. 
**Encrypt the File:** Once filled, store the document in a secure, encrypted location such as a password-protected ZIP or a local encrypted drive.


3. **Share Access Instructions:** Provide access details to **one** trusted person. Do not share the vault itself—only the instructions on where it is and how to open it.


4. 
**Annual Review:** Mark your calendar to review and update your vault once per year to keep your accounts and assets current.

### **⚠️ Critical Security Reminder**

**Section 3.2 (Seed Phrase Storage):** For your safety, **never** type your crypto seed phrases directly into this digital file. Use the registry to document the physical location of your phrase and the instructions for retrieval only.
