Subject: 🛡️ Time for your Annual Review: The Digital Vault Blueprint

Dear [Customer Name],

It has been one year since you established your **Digital Identity Foundation**.

Your digital life—including your passwords, documents, subscriptions, and crypto assets—is constantly evolving. To ensure your "Break Glass in Case of Emergency" file remains effective for your family, it is time for your **Annual Review**.

### **The Annual Review Checklist**

Please take 15 minutes to update the following sections of your vault:

* 
**Passwords & Accounts:** Update any changed logins for banking, email, or cloud storage.


* 
**Active Subscriptions:** Review Section 2.5 to cancel services you no longer use and add new ones.


* 
**Digital Wealth:** Update your Wallet Registry and Exchange accounts with any new assets or platforms.


* 
**Legal Documents:** Ensure the Document Locator accurately reflects the location of your current Will, Tax Returns, or Insurance Policies.


* 
**Emergency Contacts:** Verify that the primary and secondary contacts in Section 1.3 are still current.



### **A Reminder on Security**

As you update your vault, remember to re-encrypt the file using a password-protected ZIP or a local encrypted drive. Ensure your one trusted person still knows where to find the access instructions.

Stay secure,
