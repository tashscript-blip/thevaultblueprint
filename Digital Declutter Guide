## 🧹 The 60-Minute Digital Declutter Guide

A guided checklist to secure your foundation and remove digital noise.

### **Phase 1: Security Hardening (20 Minutes)**

* 
**Audit Outdated Passwords:** Identify and change passwords for critical accounts that haven't been updated in over a year.


* 
**Enable 2FA Everywhere:** Ensure Two-Factor Authentication is active on all banking, email, and social media accounts.


* 
**Hardware Key Check:** Link a physical security key to your most sensitive accounts (Email, Crypto Exchanges) for AI-era protection.



### **Phase 2: Account & App Liquidation (20 Minutes)**

* 
**Purge Unused Apps:** Delete applications from your phone and tablet that have not been opened in the last 90 days.


* 
**Close Old Accounts:** Identify and formally close legacy accounts (old forums, store memberships, or secondary emails) that no longer serve a purpose.


* 
**Unsubscribe:** Use your "Subscriptions" table (Section 2.4) to identify and cancel recurring payments for services you don't use.



### **Phase 3: Data Organization (20 Minutes)**

* 
**Delete Duplicate Files:** Use a "de-duper" tool to clear out multiple copies of the same photos or documents in your cloud storage.


* 
**Archive Important Files:** Move long-term documents (Tax returns, property deeds) to a dedicated, encrypted archive folder.


* 
**Secure Crypto Wallets:** Ensure all wallet names and public addresses are recorded in your vault and that seed phrases are physically secured.
