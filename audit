### **1. THE ACCESS AUDIT**

*If you were unreachable today, could your family unlock these devices?*

* [ ] **Primary Smartphone:** Is the passcode documented?
* [ ] **Master Laptop/Desktop:** Is the user login recorded?
* [ ] **Home Wi-Fi:** Is the router admin password stored?
* [ ] **Hardware Keys:** Are YubiKeys or 2FA backups physically located?

### **2. THE FINANCIAL FOOTPRINT**

*Do you have a "Map" of where your money lives online?*

* [ ] **Primary Banking:** List of institutions (not account numbers).
* [ ] **Investment Portfolios:** Brokerage logins (Robinhood, Schwab, etc.).
* [ ] **Hidden Subscriptions:** When was the last time you audited your "Auto-Pay" list?
* [ ] **Revenue Streams:** Stripe, PayPal, or AdSense accounts for your business.

### **3. THE CRYPTO & WEB3 RISK-CHECK**

*Note: Never type seed phrases here. Only audit their existence.*

* [ ] **Hot Wallets:** (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.) Are public addresses listed?
* [ ] **Cold Storage:** Is the physical location of your Ledger/Trezor known?
* [ ] **Exchange Accounts:** (Coinbase, Binance, etc.) Is 2FA recovery setup?
* [ ] **Seed Phrases:** Are they stored on paper/steel *offline*?

### **4. THE LEGACY & CLOUD AUDIT**

*Where are your memories and documents stored?*

* [ ] **Cloud Storage:** Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox.
* [ ] **Social Media:** Have you designated a "Legacy Contact" on Facebook/Google?
* [ ] **Domain Names:** Do you know when your URLs expire?
* [ ] **Legal Vault:** Do you have digital copies of your Will and Power of Attorney?

## **YOUR SCORE**

* **0-5 Boxes:** **CRITICAL RISK.** Your digital life is "Dark." Your family would likely be locked out of everything.
* **6-12 Boxes:** **VULNERABLE.** You have a foundation, but the "connective tissue" is missing.
* **13-16 Boxes:** **SECURE.** You are ready to finalize your **Digital Vault Blueprint**.
